            In my free time I enjoy playing the French Horn and actively participate in activities
            such as orchestra. I also have experience with the trumpet, mellophone, and have begun taking
            an interest in the piano. I also have a history in bowling, where I've bowled competitively
            alone and in team competitions. Currently, I bowl casually and average around 210.
